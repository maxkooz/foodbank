# Foodbank
Foodbank is a volunteer tracking system for food banks to help track volunteerâ€™s availability, frequency of participation, coordinate transportation of volunteers to and from each food bank, and record which foods are most in need.

## Run Locally
After cloning the git repo, run the following commands to start the server:
- `python manage.py migrate`
- `python manage.py runserver`

You can use the `Setup DB` button on the main page after creating a user and logging in to add sample data to your local DB. This essentially just executes a bunch of SQL insert statements, so don't use it more than once and be careful using it after already adding data.
